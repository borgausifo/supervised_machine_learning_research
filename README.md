# Project Title

Income Classification with Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms and Their Performance 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install in your local computer are given below. 

```
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas]
- [matplotlib]
- [scikit-learn]
- [Ipython] 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

* For installing Python 2.7 into anaconda environment 

```
conda create -n python2 python=2.7 anaconda
```

Above terminal code will create an environment named python2 that contains Python 2.7 version of Anaconda.


```
source activate python2 
```

Above terminal execution will activate the environment. 

* Another approach for installing 2.7 and changing the environment inside of the Jupyter notebook explained below. If you have Python 3, you can set up Python 2 Kernel like this;

```
python -m pip intall ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user
```
If you have Python 2;

```
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
```
Then you can see in your Jupyter notebook both Python 2.7 and 3.5 versions shown in below picture.
